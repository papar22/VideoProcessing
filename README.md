The main aim of the work is to automatically create an appropriate layout for online courses and lectures.  In this case, a proper framework should be composed of both the lecture slides and the speaker/teacher. To this aim, computer vision and machine learning  based algorithms are applied.

There are many advantages to online and computer-based learning when compared to traditional face-to-face courses and lectures, however, there are a few disadvantages as well.
Online courses are great for self-motivated individuals who want to learn new skills and advance their careers and their knowledge without attending in the colouge or university. Getting education online will also save tons of money. Although some would argue that online education is only an awesome alternative to traditional education because of the savings and convenience, there are actually many other advantages. Only online education fully integrates itself into todayâ€™s educational technology. It is also more efficient for fast and especially motivated learners and offers skills that lack resources in traditional education despite high demand from employers.
